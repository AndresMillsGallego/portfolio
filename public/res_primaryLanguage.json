      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Andres Mills Gallego. I am a full stack software developer.  I am also a first generation immigrant  from Colombia, South America.  I now live and work in Seattle, Wa.I am a lifelong woodworker who loves to learn new things. My background is in construction where my strengths were definitely problem solving and implementing the clientâ€™s vision.  I leaned into these strengths, as well as a love for the creative side of the industry and started my own business 16 years ago. When I started I was the sole employee, but after many years of hard work and dedication I grew my business into one of the most respected in the area. A lot of the same skills that I was able to develop while being a business owner, craftsman and contractor translate seamlessly into the world of software development.  Strong communication, the ability to work with a team and the need to problem solve when necessary are all skills that I enjoy utilizing while working as a software developer. Thank you ðŸ’œ",
